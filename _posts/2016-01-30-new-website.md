description: A long overdue update to my website
---

I spend every day working on the web, whether that's at work or in my own time - I'm always messing around with some code in some way or another.

However, one area that's always failed to keep my attention is my own website, so much so that my own domain (mattcouchman.co.uk) expired nearly 6 months ago!

So today I sat down, purchased my domain again and messed around with some code to come up with the site you're on now. Nothing flashy or complicated, just a place for me to start writing a bit more about the trials and tribulations of front end development.

<!--excerpt-->

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - for free! (Thanks GitHub).

So what now? Well my plan is to start blogging regularly about all kinds of things in the dev world. I spend so much time reading and using things that my peers have made available for free, and I feel like it's time to try and start contributing to that myself - hopefully helping a few people out along the way.

Feel free to check me out on CodePen or Github and if you want to get in touch, just leave a comment below or [Tweet me](http://twitter.com/mattcouchman) :)
